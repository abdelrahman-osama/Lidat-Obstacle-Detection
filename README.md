A few updates to the instructions above were needed.

* libvtk needed to be updated to libvtk6-dev instead of (libvtk5-dev). The linker was having trouble locating libvtk5-dev while building, but this might not be a problem for everyone.

* BUILD_visualization needed to be manually turned on, this link shows you how to do that,
